# Jigsaw - React
This is the React library version of my Jigsaw component library.  
This is a compiled library and is not developed directly, for more information check out the [Stencil React Integration Docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react).

## Installation
You can install this library in your React projects via npm:
```bash
npm install @ben-ryder/jigsaw-react
```

## Usage
To use these components within your React app simply import the component and use it like you would anything else:

```tsx
import {Button} from '@ben-ryder/jigsaw-react';

export function Component() {
  return (
    <Button>Hello World</Button>
  )
}
```
