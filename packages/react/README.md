# Jigsaw
A design system and component library for use in my personal projects.

[Explore Design System & Components](https://jigsaw.benryder.dev/)

## Packages
- `@ben-ryder/jigsaw` (`packages/core`) - The core package of Jigsaw which is pure HTML & CSS, built using [Fractal](https://fractal.build).
- `@ben-ryder/jigsaw-react` (`packages/react`) - A React component library which wraps the pure HTML/CSS components in React specific interfaces.

## Contributions
This project is currently open source, not open contribution.  
You're welcome to make suggestions, raise bugs and ask questions if you want
but as I'm primarily developing this for use in my own projects I wouldn't really consider this library stable for other people as I may change things unexpectedly (although I do use semantic versioning).
