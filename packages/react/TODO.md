# TODO
- I've had to introduce spacing-0-625 for the inputs, should potentially re-evaluate spacing system. Maybe use just numbers or pixel values for tokens?
- Input also looks better with 16px text size which is in between text-size-sm and text-size-rg, so should potentially re-evaluate text sizes.
