# Borders
Jigsaw provides a number of predefined width and radius values for borders.

## Border Radius
The small radius can be used on UI elements like panels to soften up the edges, and the medium radius can be
used when a rounded effect is specifically desired such as on form elements or buttons.

| Token       | Value  | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `radius-sm` | `4px`  |             |
| `radius-md` | `6px`  |             |
| `radius-lg` | `8px`  |             |
| `radius-xl` | `10px` |             |

## Border Width
The small width can be used in most situations. The medium width is most notably used for form elements and the large and extra large widths are used decoratively and will most often be used on only one side of the element such as the top or left.

| Token             | Value | Description |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| `border-width-sm` | `1px` |             |
| `border-width-md` | `2px` |             |
| `border-width-lg` | `4px` |             |
| `border-width-xl` | `8px` |             |
