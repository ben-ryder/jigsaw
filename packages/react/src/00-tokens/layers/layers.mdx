# Layers
Jigsaw has quite a flat design, however elevation & depth can still be conveyed through the use of different colour shades and subtle shadow.

In dark theme, shades can be used to mimic how light would work in the real world, so elements that appear over the top or "nearer" to the user would use a lighter shade.

## Shadows

| Token       | Value                               | Description |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `shadow-sm` | `0 1px 3px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);`   |             |
| `shadow-md` | `0 4px 6px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);`   |             |
| `shadow-lg` | `0 5px 15px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);`  |             |
| `shadow-xl` | `0 10px 25px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);` |             |

## z-index
These z-index values can be used to layer/order content.

| Token     | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `layer-1` | `20`  |             |
| `layer-2` | `40`  |             |
| `layer-3` | `60`  |             |
| `layer-4` | `80`  |             |
| `layer-5` | `100` |             |
