# Breakpoints
Breakpoints are designed to be mobile-first which means the mobile styling should be created first and then breakpoints can be used to change the styling as the screen width increases.

CSS variables can't be used in media queries yet, however Jigsaw uses [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/transpilation.html#custom-media-queries) to add support for the [Custom Media Queries](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#custom-mq) CSS draft spec.
