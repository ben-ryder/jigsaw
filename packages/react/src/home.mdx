  # Welcome to Jigsaw!
  Jigsaw is a design system and component library for use in my personal projects.<br/>
  Its aim is to provide universal styling and reusable components to speed up developing personal websites and applications,
  while also giving me a place to experiment with design systems in general.

  You can explore the design system and all the components using this Storybook instance.<br/>
  To learn more and have a peek at the code, check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw).

  ## Statuses
  All parts of the component library have a status which shows how stable they are for use.
  There are currently four statuses, shown below:

  <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Identifier</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>experimental</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              In development, use cases still being ironed out, not at all
              ready for production use.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>unstable</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Initially developed but still needs more refinement, could use
              in production but things might change.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>stable</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Ready for use in production, unlikely to have major changes.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>deprecated</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Being phased out and/or replaced, use the replacement instead.
          </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>

  ## Credits
  I couldn't have built a design system like this without using various resources, tools and other design systems for help and inspiration:

  <table>

      <th>Notes</th>
