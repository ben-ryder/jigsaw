  # Welcome to Jigsaw!
  Jigsaw is my personal design system and component library.<br />
  My aim is to explore creating a universal "brand style" and reusable components to develop websites and
  applications.<br />
  It also gives me a place to learn more about design systems, UX/UI design and experiment with different front-end
  development practises.

  You can explore the design system and all available components using this Storybook instance, and find the code at
  [github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw).

  ## Usage Status
  All parts of the component library have a status which shows how stable they are for use.
  There are currently four statuses, shown below:

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Identifier</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>experimental</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        In development, use cases still being ironed out, not at all
        ready for production use.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>unstable</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Initially developed but still needs more refinement, could use
        in production but things might change.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>stable</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Ready for use in production, unlikely to have major changes.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>deprecated</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Being phased out and/or replaced, use the replacement instead.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
