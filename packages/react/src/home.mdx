    # Welcome to Jigsaw!
    Jigsaw is a design system and component library for use in my personal
    projects. It aims to provide universal styling and reusable components
    that I can use to speed up developing my websites and applications.

    You can explore the design system and all the components using this
    website. To learn more and have a peek at the code, check out the
    [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw).

    ## Statuses
    All parts of the component library have a status which shows how stable they are for use.
    There are currently four statuses, shown below:

    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Identifier</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>experimental</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                In development, use cases still being ironed out, not at all
                ready for production use.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>unstable</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Initially developed but still needs more refinement, could use
                in production but things might change.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>stable</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Ready for use in production, unlikely to have major changes.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>deprecated</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Being phased out and/or replaced, use the replacement instead.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    ## Credits
    I couldn't have built a design system like this without using various
    articles, resources and other design systems for help and inspiration.

    - [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com)
        - Some really useful design tips and starting points for spacing, text size and shadow systems.
    - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
        - Used to cross-reference spacing and text size systems.
        - Some of Jigsaw's colour palettes started with Tailwind colours, although all have been modified.
    - [blog.superhuman.com](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-design-delightful-dark-themes)
        - Some great tips on how to design a dark mode, especially around achieving elevation and depth with colour.
    - [seeds.sproutsocial.com](https://seeds.sproutsocial.com/visual/motion)
        - My current motion and animation system is taken from this design system.
    - [ionicframework.com](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#ionic-breakpoints)
        - My current breakpoints are taken from this design system.
