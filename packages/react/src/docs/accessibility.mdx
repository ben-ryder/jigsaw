# Accessibility
Jigsaw is built to be accessible. This means ensuring things like adequate colour contrast and to follow [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

<br/>
## Light Mode and Dark Mode
Jigsaw supports light mode and dark mode. It is developed dark mode first, but by default will respect the
users preferred theme as defined by the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query.

The theme can also be explicitly set via the classes `theme-light` and `theme-dark` for all children.
The allows the users device settings to be respected by default, while also giving applications the ability to give users an explicit choice.

## Implementation
To save time and reduce the risk of me making mistakes while implementing accessible patterns, Jigsaw uses third party libraries to help develop component functionality:

- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives for most things that need to be accessible such as menus, modals etc.
- [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/use-combobox) to implement the Combobox component with multi select functionality.
- [cmdk](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk) to implement the CommandBar component.
