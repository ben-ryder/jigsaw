I'm a developer not a designer, and as such I couldn't build a design system like this without 
using various articles, resources and other design systems for help and inspiration.

- [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/)
  - I've used their suggested spacing, text size and shadow systems.
  - Some really useful design tips in general too!
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - Used to cross-reference spacing and text size systems.
  - Some of Jigsaw's colour palettes started with Tailwind colours, although all have been modified.
- [blog.superhuman.com](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-design-delightful-dark-themes/)
  - Some great tips on how to design a dark mode, especially around achieving elevation and depth with colour.
- [seeds.sproutsocial.com](https://seeds.sproutsocial.com/visual/motion/)
  - My current motion and animation system is taken from this design system.
- [ionicframework.com](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#ionic-breakpoints)
  - My current breakpoints are taken from this design system.
