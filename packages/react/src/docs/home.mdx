# Welcome to Jigsaw!
Jigsaw is my personal design system and component library.<br/>
My aim is to explore creating a universal "brand style" and reusable components to develop websites and applications.<br/>
It also gives me a place to learn more about design systems, UX/UI design and experiment with different front-end development practises.

You can explore the design system and all available components using this Storybook instance, and find the code at [github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw).

## Usage Status
All parts of the component library have a status which shows how stable they are for use.
There are currently four statuses, shown below:

| Identifier   | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| experimental | In development, use cases still being ironed out, not at all ready for production use.                |
| unstable     | Initially developed but still needs more refinement, could use in production but things might change. |
| stable       | Ready for use in production, unlikely to have major changes.                                          |
| deprecated   | Being phased out and/or replaced, use the replacement instead.                                        |

## Credits
I couldn't have built a design system like this without using various resources, tools and other design systems for help and inspiration:
