# Structure
I define Jigsaw as a "design system", but what does  that mean to me?
- **"Brand" Feel** - A visual "brand" for myself, and systems which define this like colours, spacing, borders, typography etc.
- **Component Library** - An implementation of the design system into reusable React components.

## Atomic Design
Jigsaw uses principles of [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to structure the design system, although it doesn't try to strictly conform to any single methodology:
- **Tokens** - Design tokens are the foundational level and define primitive values.
- **Atoms** - Basic building blocks which are generally composed together (button, form elements, icons etc)
- **Components** - More complex and "complete" than atoms (dialog, accordion, tooltip etc)
- **Templates** - A layout of multiple atoms and components. Generally used for examples rather than being designed for applications to consume.

## Design Tokens
Jigsaw uses a design token schema to keep things consistent, although not all components implement all tokens.
Here are the schemas used:
- `<component>-bg`
- `<component>-bg-hover`
- `<component>-bg-focus`
- `<component>-text`
- `<component>-text-hover`
- `<component>-text-focus`
- `<component>-border`
- `<component>-border-hover`
- `<component>-border-focus`
- `<component>-<variant>-bg`
- `<component>-<variant>-bg-hover`
- `<component>-<variant>-bg-focus`
- `<component>-<variant>-text`
- `<component>-<variant>-text-hover`
- `<component>-<variant>-text-focus`
- `<component>-<variant>-border`
- `<component>-<variant>-border-hover`
- `<component>-<variant>-border-focus`
