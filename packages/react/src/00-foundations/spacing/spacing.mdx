  # Spacing
  In order to keep the design system consistent and easy to develop with a spacing system is used. <br/>
  This system is not linear, meaning more options are available for smaller sizes where the difference between two values is more pronounced.

  A base value of <strong>2</strong> is used and all other values are calculated from that. For example:
  - <code>j-space-4</code> is <strong>2 x 4 = 8px</strong>
  - <code>j-space-16</code> is <strong>2 x 16 = 32px</strong>

  Here is a full list of the available spacing options:

  {Object.entries(SIZES).map(([identifier, value]) => (
    <div className="size-item">
      <span style={{ minWidth: `${value}` }}></span>
      <code>
        {identifier}
        {` | `}
        {value}
      </code>
    </div>
  ))}
