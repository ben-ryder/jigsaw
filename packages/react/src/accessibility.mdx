    # Accessibility

    All of Jigsaw's components are built to be accessible and to follow [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

    To save time and reduce the risk of me making mistakes while implementing these patterns, Jigsaw uses third party libraries to help develop component functionality:

    - [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives for most things that need to be accessible such as menus, modals etc.
    - [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/use-combobox) to implement the Combobox component with multi select functionality.
    - [cmdk](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk) to implement the CommandBar component.
