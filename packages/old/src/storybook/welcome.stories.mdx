# Welcome to Jigsaw!
Jigsaw is a React & Tailwind CSS component library for use in my personal projects.

It aims to provide a universal set of styling and components that I can use to speed up developing my projects that use React and Tailwind.
It's basically just my custom version of libraries like [MUI](https://mui.com/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

You can browse all components using this Storybook instance and learn more in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/jigsaw).
