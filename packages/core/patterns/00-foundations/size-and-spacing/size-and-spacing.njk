        <h1>Spacing and Size</h1>
        <p>In order to keep the design system consistent and easy to develop with a spacing & size system is used.
            This system is not linear, meaning more options are avaliable for smaller sizes where the
            difference between two sizes is more pronounced.</p>

        <p>A base value of <strong>16</strong> is used and all other values are calculated from that.
            For example:
        <ul>
            <li><code>$j-size-0-75</code> is <strong>16 x 0.75 = 12px</strong></li>
            <li><code>$j-size-32</code> is <strong>16 x 32 = 512px</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This system is mainly used when adding space between elements and components, but it has been made generic as <code>$j-size-</code>
            because it could also be used when picking the size of UI elements.
        </p>

            {% for size in sizes %}
                <div class="size-item">
                    <span style="min-width: calc(16px * {{size.value}})"></span>
                    <code>{{size.identifier}}</code>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
