    # Welcome to Jigsaw!
    Jigsaw is my personal design system and component library.<br/>
    My aim is to explore creating a universal "brand style" and reusable components to develop websites and applications.<br/>
    It also gives me a place to learn more about design systems, UX/UI design and experiment with different front-end development practises.

    You can explore the design system and all available components using this Storybook instance, and find the code at [github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw).

    ## Usage Status
    All parts of the component library have a status which shows how stable they are for use.
    There are currently four statuses, shown below:

    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Identifier</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>experimental</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              In development, use cases still being ironed out, not at all
              ready for production use.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>unstable</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Initially developed but still needs more refinement, could use
              in production but things might change.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>stable</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Ready for use in production, unlikely to have major changes.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>
              <code>deprecated</code>
          </td>
          <td>
              Being phased out and/or replaced, use the replacement instead.
          </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    ## Credits
    I couldn't have built a design system like this without using various resources, tools and other design systems for help and inspiration:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Credit</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>

    </tr>
    <tr>

        [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
      </td>
      <td>
        Used to cross-reference spacing and text size systems.<br/>
        Some of my colour palettes started with Tailwind colours too, although all have been modified.
