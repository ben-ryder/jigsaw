        <h1>Icons</h1>
        <p>Jigsaw does not come with any predefined icons built in because there is no way
        of knowing which icons consuming apps would need and including all icons from an icon library would
        lead to package bloat. I may be able to implement some sort of icon tree-shaking system but that's
        a lot of extra complexity for this base package.</p>

        <p>Right now it is assumed that icons will come from <a href="https://lucide.dev/">Lucide Icons</a>. For this base
        library, the SVG elements from Lucide icons are hardcoded into the component demos. It is assumed that
        most applications using Jigsaw will use a library wrapper like <code>@ben-ryder/jigsaw-react</code> and that these
        libraries can then use the library-specific versions of Lucide icons such as <a href="https://lucide.dev/docs/lucide-react">Lucide React</a>
        for easily including the icons.</p>

        <svg class="j-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-6.219-8.56"></path></svg>

        <h2>Icon Styling</h2>
        <p>When components need to make asusmptions about - and style - icons they target the CSS class <code>j-icon</code>.</p>
