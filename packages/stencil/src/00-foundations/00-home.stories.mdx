# Welcome to Jigsaw!
Jigsaw is a design system and component library for use in my personal projects.  
It aims to provide a universal design system and components that I can use to speed up developing my websites and applications.
It's basically just my custom version of libraries like [MUI](https://mui.com/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

You can explore the design system and all the components using this Storybook instance.  
To learn more, including how to use the library itself, check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/jigsaw).
