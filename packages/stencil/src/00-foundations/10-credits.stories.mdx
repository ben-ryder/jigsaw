# Credits
I'm a developer not a designer, and as such I couldn't build a design system like this without
using various articles, resources and other design systems for help and inspiration.

- [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/)
  - Some really useful design tips.
  - Predefined spacing and typography systems which I've used.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
