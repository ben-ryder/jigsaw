# Identity
I'm not some big corporation that needs to write proper guidelines on copy tone and branding, but I think informally setting out some
high level design and "brand identity" goals might help guide me when thinking about the look and feel of the system and components in general... so I'm gonna go for it.

I want my design system, websites and applications to be:

**Never Corporate, Never Bland**  
There's a particular sort of website that just feels "corporate" to me. I'm thinking of a mostly subtle colour scheme
made up of whites and greys of some kind, with occasional splashes of brand colours (often blue), grey borders with subtle
corners etc...  
While I don't actually dislike this sort of design, I ideally don't want my sites and applications to be like this. I want them
to be a bit different and have their own "identity".

**Familiar but Different**  
I don't want my design system to be totally crazy, but equally I'd like someone to visit my site or other applications
to maybe see a few things that are a little different.

**Playful but not Wacky**  
Trying to make something a little different is all well and good, but I'll draw the line at having big, luminous pink buttons that shake
when you hover over them and headings written in comic sans...
