# Design

## Penpot Library
The `penpot` folder contains a [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) library for Jigsaw so the design system
(colours, components etc) can be used when building designs & prototypes.

You can learn more about Penpot's library features in their documentation:
- Asset Libraries: https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/libraries/
- Import/Export Files: https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/import-export/

## Palettte
The `palette` folder contains an export of all colour palettes from https://palettte.app/.  
It can be imported into that website to view and modify the colours in a visual way.
