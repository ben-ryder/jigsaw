## ü§î About
Jigsaw aims to provide universal styling and reusable components that I can utilise to speed up developing my websites and applications.  
While I could use existing component libraries, developing my own gives me the opportunity to customise everything while also
giving me the space to practise writing CSS, using Storybook, applying atomic design, using accessible component patterns etc

You can explore the design system and all the components using the live Storybook instance: https://jigsaw.benryder.dev/.

## üí¨ Contributions
This project is currently open source, not open contribution.  
You're welcome to make suggestions, raise bugs and ask questions if you want
but as I'm primarily developing this for use in my own projects I wouldn't really consider this library stable for other people as I may change things unexpectedly (although I do use semantic versioning).
