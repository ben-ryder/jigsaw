# Jigsaw
A design system and component library for use in my personal projects.

## Packages
- `@ben-ryder/jigsaw` (`packages/stencil`) - The main Stencil project, published to npm it is the standard web components package.
- `@ben-ryder/jigsaw-react` (`packages/stencil-react`) - A React version of the component library.

## Contributions
This project is currently open source, not open contribution.  
You're welcome to make suggestions, raise bugs and ask questions if you want
but as I'm primarily developing this for use in my own projects I wouldn't really consider this library stable for other people as I may change things unexpectedly (although I do use semantic versioning).
