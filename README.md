## Contributions
This project is currently open source, not open contribution.  
You're welcome to make suggestions, raise bugs and ask questions if you want
but as I'm primarily developing this for use in my own projects I wouldn't really consider this library stable for other people as I may change things unexpectedly (although I do use semantic versioning).
