## Requirements:
- Usable across different frameworks & tech stacks, so it's hopefully flexible and future proof.
- Built from the ground up (not using Tailwind for example). This is mostly just to make me learn more about how
to build a design system and to help me learn more about CSS.

## Examples and Inspiration
- A general design system:
  - Tone and feeling
  - Colour Palette (light and dark variations)
  - Typography
  - Spacing system
    - can't be linear

  - Breakpoint system
  - Elevation system

    - Shadow system?
  - Border system
    - outer and inner borders should have different radii to prevent illusion?
