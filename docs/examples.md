# Examples
An example setup of a React + Vite + Typescript project used for testing can be found in the codebase at [`tests/react`](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/jigsaw/tree/main/tests/react).

I am also using Jigsaw in a number of real projects too:
- [Athena](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/athena): A local-first web app for notes, tasks, journaling, habit tracking and reminders.
- [benryder.me](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/benryder.me): My personal website.
- [network-monitor](https://github.com/Ben-Ryder/network-monitor): A dashboard for measuring and visualising your internet speeds.
